    "### How to Manage Kernels in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Managing kernels is a key part of using Jupyter Notebooks. A kernel is the computational engine that executes the code in a notebook. It's the \"brain\" behind the scenes that runs your Python, R, or other language code. When you start a notebook, you're also starting a kernel, and any variables or imports you define are stored within that kernel's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Switching and Using Different Kernels\n",
    "**Switching the Kernel:** To change the kernel, go to the top menu bar and select Kernel > Change kernel. A dropdown menu will appear showing the available kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using a New Kernel:** If you have other language kernels installed, like for R or Julia, you can select one from the list. Once you switch, all the code you write and execute will be run by that new kernel. For example, if you switch to an R kernel, you can now write and run R code in your cells instead of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running a Simple Command:** After switching, create a new code cell and run a simple command for that language. For instance, if you switched to an R kernel, you could run ***print(\"Hello from R!\")*** to see a different language in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resetting the Kernel\n",
    "**Restarting the Kernel:** To reset the kernel and clear all outputs, go to Kernel > Restart & Clear Output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observing the Effect:** When you do this, the kernel's memory is completely wiped. Any variables you defined are gone, and all cell outputs disappear. You'll notice that the cell numbers In [ ] will reset. This is useful for starting a fresh session without closing and reopening your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Re-running Code:** If you want to use the variables and outputs again, you will need to re-run all the relevant cells in the notebook."

    "**PDF Export**\n",
    "PDF is ideal for creating a static, print-ready document. It's best used when you need to submit a formal report or an academic paper, as it preserves the layout of your notebook's code, outputs, and text in a clean, professional format that is difficult to alter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTML Export**\n",
    "HTML is perfect for sharing your work with others who may not have Jupyter Notebooks installed. The file is a self-contained web page that displays all the notebook's content, including formatted text and visualizations, in any web browser. It's a great way to showcase your project to a wider audience."
